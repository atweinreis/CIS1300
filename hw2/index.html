<p> This is my Second Homework Assingment for CIS 1300 using dreamweaver. In my opinion I beleive this software is really useful for people who are making website.<br> The difference between dreamweaver and notepad++ is that Dreamweaver gives you precode on &nbsp;inserting pictures, tables, and videos. With notepad++ from CIS 1310 you have to figure out of what sizes of your pictures &nbsp;and figure&nbsp; out manually of how to you want your tables to be.<br> Overall DreamWeaver is a quailty program to use for making websites. I do also like notepad++ as well, it is recommend to use if you want the best text editor for making websites. </p>

<p> This picture I have is a character from the anime series called Bonobono. His name is raccoon. He is so cute and he's one of my favorite characters from the anime.<br> I have also a plush of him. If you want to watch the anime series bono bono, the link is down below after the line break I really recommend watching it. <br> The website is called <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/bono-bono" target="_blank">crunchyroll.com</a></p>
